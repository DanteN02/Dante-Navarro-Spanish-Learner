<p2> So one of the projects we have done is make an app on App Inventer. Ours is called Spanish Learner.
With App Inventor, we were able to design it and make it work the way we wanted. Our final product worked great.
It wasn't perfect but it was a good outcome in the end.</2p>

<p3>This is Light Bot. In Light Bot we basically learned how to piece together code so that an action could be done.
There were 3 levels, basics, procedures and loops, each getting harder as the levels passed. It was tricking at first on how to place the code so we could complete the level.</p3>
