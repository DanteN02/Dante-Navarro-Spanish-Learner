<p1>So this is a portfolio of what I have done in my Comp-Science class.</p1>
                    
<div align=center />
<p2> So one of the projects we have done is make an app on App Inventer. Ours is called Spanish Learner.<p2>
<p3>With App Inventor, we were able to design it and make it work the way we wanted.</p3>
