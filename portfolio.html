<p2> So one of the projects we have done is make an app on App Inventor. Ours is called Spanish Learner.
With App Inventor, we were able to design it and make it work the way we wanted. Our final product worked great.
It wasn't perfect but it was a good outcome in the end.</2p>

<p3> This is Light Bot. In Light Bot we basically learned how to piece together code so that an action could be done.
There were 3 levels, basics, procedures and loops, each getting harder as the levels passed.
It was tricking at first on how to place the code so we could complete the level.</p3>

<p4> Khan Academy was a big help on building this website and the others I have done.
In Khan Academy, I was able to learn some basics of CSS and HTML.
It was difficult to get understand how we could use all of this but it did help me make this website.</p4>

<p5> Before learning the basics of HTML and CSS on Khan Academy, I learned how to code a game on One of Hour, also on Khan Academy.
With this activity, it really helped to understand the flow of how the code should work.
Every activity helped me in how to use the code correctly.</5p>

<p6> We used a website called Scratch that is used to create games, apps, and much more with its own code.
One project we did on Scratch was to animate a figure to do whatever, from walking to jumping to playing a game as long as it worked. 
We did do another project that required to change an original game into a different one.</p6>
